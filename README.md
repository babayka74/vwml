Brief description
====
We have designed a language VWML (Virtual World Modeling Language)

and developed the associated technologies and tools, for the creation of “virtual 

worlds”.  The technology is particular suitable for the development of various 

types of game.

The language of VWML describes the entities of the world and the 

relationships between them. Virtual worlds are “inhabited” by various entities, 

which can be both people (players, in particular) and virtual characters. The events 

taking place in the virtual world, are produced by its nature (the laws) and the 

behavior of the various entities in it.

We can say that VWML is focused on the description of virtual worlds, their 

evolution and the behavior of the entities, “inhabiting” it. 

Foresaid enables us to call the programming in VWML the anthropomorphic 

programming.

The offered tool is based on the ideas of math logic, the theory of finite 

automata and functional approach to programming. 

It’s worth mentioning that the projected world is a model of a formal theory 

and the realization of a common scheme.

By analyzing different implementations of the same scheme, various plot 

fillings and interface variations we are able to create “game families”.

Let’s define the conceptual provisions of VWM technology. 

====
Paradigm 1
====
The virtual world is a set of entities or individuals which are in 

relationships with each other.

====
Paradigm 2
====
The virtual world is a model of a formal theory.

The axioms of this theory are the laws of the virtual world.

====
Paradigm 3 (evolutionary paradigm)
====
Any change in the virtual world is a change of the complex of 

individuals (entities) that “inhabit” this world or a change of the 

relationship between the entities.

====
Paradigm 4 (paradigm of the permanent laws)
====
World evolution does not change its laws. 

The virtual world is a “variable” model of a specified formal theory.

====
Paradigm 5 (paradigm of occurring events)
====
By modifying interpretation of the formal theory we are talking about 

the events taking place in the virtual world.

The events taking place in the virtual world are initiated by intelligent 

beings that are “inhabiting this world”.

====
The system translates the world described by VWML in high-level 

languages, such as: java, java-script, c++; thus we are able to implement VWML 

projects on any platform (to keep the cross-platform factor).
